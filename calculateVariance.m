%CALCULATEVARIANCE Calculate the variance retained after running PCA on a dataset
%   variance = calculateVariance(X_approx, X) computes the variance retained
%              on image set X after PCA is used to compress the image set into
%              D eigenvectors.
%   Returns the variance as a double from 0-1, where 1 is equivalent to 100% 
%             variance retained
%   Inputs:
%       X = the recovered matrix after projecting the data onto D eigenvectors
%       X = dataset matrix
%       dim = dimensionality of the problem, how many vectors should be output.

% Initialize
