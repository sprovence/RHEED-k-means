%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each column is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. It will return a matrix
%   centroids, where each column of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.

%    Inputs:
%           X = Input dataset matrix
%           idx = Vector input of centroid assignments (int)
%           K = The number of centroids

% Initialize values

                    % m is the number of pixels in each image

% Go over every cluster and compute mean of all points that belong to it. 
% Concretely, the column vector centroids(:, i) should contain the mean of the 
% data points assigned to cluster i.
